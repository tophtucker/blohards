        <h2>Left for dead, Sox, BLOHARDS unexpectedly stir…</h2>

        <br />

        <h2>Who wouldn’t want to go to Worcester?</h2>
        <p>
            The Worcester Red Sox (aka the WooSox) will be holding Prostate
            Cancer Awareness Night on Tuesday, August 19. Ed Randall’s charity,
            Fans for the Cure, will be visiting Polar Park for the second
            consecutive year to throw out the first pitch and join in the NESN
            regional broadcast to make viewers aware of the importance of early
            detection of the disease.
        </p>

        <p>
            Should anyone from the BLOHARDS wish to attend, please contact Fans
            for the Cure at
            <a href="mailto:info@fansforthecure.org">info@fansforthecure.org</a
            >. More details will be shared in the upcoming weeks as they become
            available.
        </p>

        <p>
            Voted by several outlets as the #1 ranked Minor League team for its
            overall management, the WooSox provide a Major League experience in
            a low-key and friendly atmosphere and in a ballpark that is among
            the country’s best.
        </p>

        <h2>Lunch!</h2>
        We’re in the initial stages of a sketching out a tentative proposal to
        have a BLOHARD get-together on Sept. 18 or 19. If it occurs to you, you
        might want to consider saving the date.

        <h2>NESN broadcast schedule</h2>

        <p>
            The end of baseball season leaves a gaping hole in NESN’s broadcast
            schedule. The network does the best it can. Herewith the program
            guide for the evening of February 9, 2025…
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>7:00 Mission Impossible</strong> A recap of Dominic Smith
            and Romy Gonzalez’s attempts to fill in for Tristan Casas after the
            latter’s 2024 season-ending injury.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>8:00 Password</strong> An intimate look at the life of Red
            Sox prospect Jhostynxon Garcia. In this episode, Garcia, for the
            third time, is required to return checks to his bank due to the
            misspelling of his name.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>9:00 Storage Wars</strong> In competition with other MLB
            executives, Red Sox General Manager Craig Breslow maneuvers to
            purchase the contents of abandoned storage units sight-unseen.
            Tonight, Breslow heads to Vegas and returns with utility player
            Abraham Toro and a leaky ice bath.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>10:00 Cheaper By the Dozens,</strong> Episode 6: Moving fast
            to cover a lot of ground, NESN’s crack analytics squad provides
            insights into the Sox’ roster of major league outfielders. This
            episode focuses on players names beginning with the letters Q – Re.

        <h2>From the desk of Vicente Romo…</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings, BLOHARDS, Red Sox fans, <em>beisbol</em> lovers, and all
            the ships at sea. Your ole buddy Vicente Romo is back with more
            mullings and musings – “El Huevo” style:
        </p>

        <p>
            Amigos, we are living in highly interesting times in Red Sox Nation.
            Thanks to a 10-game winning streak – in which the Rockies and
            Nationals played the role of the Washington Generals – the Sox sit
            at 55-49 and are in a logjam for one of the AL wild card slots.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Raffy was told “Not so fast” as he was boarding the team
            charter bound for Seattle on June 15, the assumption was that the
            37-36 Sox were waving the white flag on the 2025. But guess what –
            they came out of the All-Star break the hottest team in MLB. A
            sadistic schedule-maker (Cubs, Phillies, and now the Dodgers) may
            have slowed the juggernaut a bit. But still, the boys are in the
            race.

            Yay or nay on the <strong>Savannah Bananas?</strong>
            <strong>Enrique</strong> not a big fan, except for calling outs when
            spectators catch foul balls on a fly? That is a rule MLB needs to
            adapt. Yesterday….The real Breakfast of Champions is Grape Nut
            Flakes and a box score….<strong>Devers</strong> ranks among Boston’s
            biggest breakups – up there with <strong>Brady</strong> to Tampa,
            <strong>Babe Ruth</strong> to Yankees, <strong>Clemens</strong> to
            Blue Jays, <strong>Fisk</strong> to White Sox,
            <strong>Mookie</strong> to Dodgers, <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> and
            <strong>J. Lo</strong> from one another (2x)….Can cellphones call
            411? Asking for a friend….Sox are 18-13 (as of July 24) since
            <strong>Devers</strong> to Giants….As someone said, Raffy performing
            in SF like a Dunkin’ gift card with 38 cents left on it….Anybody see
            the <strong>Bobby Dylan</strong> movie? The actor’s voice was
            uncanny. Catch it on American Airlines…..Speaking of, you get the
            full 12 oz. cans on American, the miniature 8 oz. cans on Alaska
            Air. Just sayin’……Used to love the press box at the old Comiskey
            Park. Although two of the chefs never wore gloves….What a strange
            way to a walk-off loss – on catcher’s interference! Bases were
            loaded with no outs, so the odds were against getting out of the
            inning. But it looked like the batter stepped back and aimed for the
            catcher’s glove….By the way, swinging at the glove is exactly what
            <strong>Enrique</strong> would have done when facing a 100 mph
            blur….According to <strong>Will Jennings</strong> on WEEI, Shaw’s is
            the only place to shop, especially for celery….The hottest-selling
            Red Sox jersey of them all? Not <strong>Ted Williams</strong>,
            <strong>Jimmy Foxx</strong>, <strong>Johnny Pesky</strong>,
            <strong>Yaz</strong>, or <strong>Big Papi</strong>. It’s
            <strong>Jarren Duran’s</strong> no. 16, currently 12th among all MLB
            jerseys, making him the only current Red Sox player in the MLB Top
            20…If anything, <strong>Garrett Crochet</strong> has been
            underrated. You heard me….Sox are 5th in AL in runs scored, 9th in
            MLB in run differential. Can you say “Probably good enough for
            expanded wild card”?....I still love the story from 2021 where
            <strong>Bo Bichette</strong> hit a Fenway HR that landed outside the
            building that once housed Gold’s Gym, where his parents had met in
            the summer of 1991….<strong>Ed Randall’s</strong> show
            <em>Remember When</em> can be found on SiriusXM on MLB Network
            Radio….Is Enrique the only one who believes the
            <strong>BLOHARDS</strong> should do a podcast? (Quite possibly!)
            Maybe one a month – enough to be in the game and have a few laughs.

            On a somewhat related note, “Aroldis” means “lockdown ninth inning

            Do you think the Astros would give us Christian Vasquez back for

        <h2>Devers Update</h2>
        <img src="devers.jpeg" class="float-left" />
        <p>
            After exhaustive investigation, the BLOHARDS can confirm that there
            was more to Rafael Devers’ departure than has heretofore been
            reported. While it is true that Devers was unhappy both being
            benched as third baseman and then being asked to play first, sources
            close to the player have told us the breach only became irrevocable
            in early June when, in quick succession, the Sox asked Devers to
            sell hot dogs in the stands on days when he wasn’t in the lineup,
            and then requested that he serve as an intern in the team’s
            analytics department. Devers is said to have been particularly
            irritated by the latter request inasmuch as he hadn’t performed any
            linear programming in several years and it was unlikely that his
            skills… (see <em>Devers</em>, p.4)
